The entrance to the magma chamber is only about 4 x 4 meters, and you'll be lowered down 120 meters in a lift, to the bottom of the cave that's about the size of a football field. From there are a number of tunnels that go down to a 200 meter depth.",

The first descent took place in 1974, but travelers have only been able to enter this cave since 2012, when facilities were made for people to be lowered into it. People go in very small and controlled groups, to make sure that the cave is not damaged - and entering this cave is the main reason for visiting Iceland for a number of people!"
